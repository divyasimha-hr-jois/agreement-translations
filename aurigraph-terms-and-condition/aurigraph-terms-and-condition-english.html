    <h3>1.3 Agreement to Terms</h3>
    <p>Your access to and use of the Platform is expressly conditioned upon Your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By completing the registration process, downloading the Mobile Application, or using any part of the Services, You signify Your binding agreement to these Terms and the incorporated Aurigraph Privacy Policy. If You are using the Platform on behalf of an organization or entity, You represent and warrant that You have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, and in such case, "You" and "Your" will refer to that entity.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Eligibility</h3>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years of age or the age of legal majority in Your jurisdiction to enter into this Agreement and use the Platform. If You are under the age of 18, You may only use the Platform with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms, particularly concerning the processing of children's data under the DPDPA. You represent that You have the legal capacity and authority to agree to these Terms and, if applicable, to bind the entity You represent. Use of the Platform may be subject to certain geographical restrictions or compliance requirements.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Modifications to Terms</h3>
    <p>Aurigraph reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, We will provide reasonable notice prior to any new terms taking effect, which may be provided via email associated with Your account, through an in-Platform notification, or by posting the updated Terms on our website. What constitutes a material change will be determined at Our sole discretion. It is Your responsibility to review these Terms periodically for changes. Your continued access or use of the Platform after any such modifications become effective constitutes Your binding acceptance of the revised Terms. However, should modifications materially alter the way Your Personal Data is processed under the DPDPA, Aurigraph may be required to obtain Your renewed specific and informed consent before such changes apply to Your data, ensuring ongoing compliance with consent requirements. Reliance solely on continued use as acceptance for significant data processing changes may not suffice under DPDPA's emphasis on explicit, informed consent prior to processing.</p>

    <h2>2. User Accounts and Registration</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Account Creation</h3>
    <p>Access to and use of certain features of the AUREX Platform requires You to register and create a user account ("Account"). The registration process may differ depending on the designated User Role (Farmer, Field Agent, Supervisor, Local Partner) and may require specific information relevant to that role. You agree to provide the information requested during the registration process accurately and completely.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Accurate Information</h3>
    <p>You represent and warrant that all information You provide during the registration process and maintain in Your Account profile is true, accurate, current, and complete. You agree to promptly update Your Account information as necessary to maintain its accuracy. Providing false, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete information may result in the suspension or termination of Your Account and access to the Platform, and may also constitute a violation of duties under applicable law, such as the DPDPA's requirement for data principals not to furnish false particulars.</p>

    <h3>2.3 Account Security</h3>
    <p>You are solely responsible for safeguarding the confidentiality of Your Account credentials, including Your username and password. You must not share Your credentials with any third party. You are fully responsible and liable for any and all activities that occur under Your Account, whether or not You have authorized such activities. You agree to notify Aurigraph immediately in writing of any suspected or actual unauthorized use of Your Account or password, or any other breach of security. Aurigraph cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from Your failure to comply with these security obligations.</p>

    <h3>2.4 Account Types and Permissions</h3>
    <p>The Platform utilizes different Account types corresponding to User Roles (Farmer, Field Agent, Supervisor, Local Partner). Each Account type is associated with specific access rights, permissions, functionalities, and data visibility within the Platform. These role-based distinctions are necessary for the operational structure of the Services and are further detailed in Section 4 of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>3. License Grant and Use Restrictions</h2>
    <h3>3.1 License Grant</h3>
    <p>Subject to Your compliance with these Terms, Aurigraph grants You a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use the AUREX Platform and, if applicable, download and install the Mobile Application on devices You own or control, solely for Your internal business operations or personal farm management purposes (as applicable to Your User Role). This license is for the purpose of enabling You to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Aurigraph, in the manner permitted by these Terms. This grant constitutes a license to use the software and services, not a transfer of title or ownership.</p>

    <h3>3.2 General Prohibitions</h3>
    <p>In connection with Your use of the Platform, You agree that You will not, and will not permit any third party to, engage in any of the following prohibited activities:</p>

    <h2>5. Data Handling: Privacy, Security, and Ownership</h2>
    <p>Aurigraph recognizes the critical importance of data collected and processed through the AUREX Platform. This section outlines the principles and obligations governing data privacy, security, and ownership.</p>

    <h3>5.1 Data Privacy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Aurigraph is committed to processing Personal Data in compliance with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, with a particular focus on the India Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA) for data pertaining to individuals in India.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> All collection, use, disclosure, storage, and protection of Personal Data by Aurigraph is governed by the Aurigraph Privacy Policy <a href="#">[Insert Link]</a>, which is hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms. The Privacy Policy provides comprehensive details on Our data practices and Your rights. You are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy carefully.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent and Notice (DPDPA Focus):</strong> The processing of Your Personal Data by Aurigraph is primarily based on Your consent, obtained in accordance with the stringent requirements of the DPDPA. This means consent must be free, specific, informed, unconditional, and unambiguous, signified through a clear affirmative action. Before or at the time of seeking Your consent, Aurigraph will provide You with a clear and plain language notice. This notice will include, at a minimum: (i) an itemized description of the Personal Data to be collected and processed; (ii) the specific purpose(s) for which the Personal Data will be processed; (iii) information on how You can exercise Your rights under the DPDPA, including the right to withdraw consent; and (iv) details on how You can make a complaint to the Data Protection Board of India. This notice will be accessible in English and potentially other languages specified in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India. Processing may also occur for certain 'legitimate uses' as defined and permitted under the DPDPA, for which consent may not be required. The specific purposes for processing will be detailed in the Privacy Policy and may include providing the core Platform services, supporting AWD management, facilitating carbon accounting, improving the Platform, ensuring security, and complying with legal obligations. Given the varied uses of data within the platform (e.g., service delivery vs. R&D), consent mechanisms will aim for granularity, allowing You to make specific choices about different processing activities involving Your Personal Data where feasible and required by law. Bundling consent for distinct purposes will be avoided where specific consent is necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent Withdrawal:</strong> You have the right to withdraw Your consent for the processing of Your Personal Data at any time. Aurigraph will provide an easily accessible mechanism (e.g., through Your Account settings or by contacting Our Data Protection Officer) for You to withdraw consent. Upon receiving a withdrawal request, Aurigraph will cease processing Your Personal Data for the purpose(s) for which consent was withdrawn within a reasonable timeframe, unless continued processing is required or authorized under the DPDPA or other applicable laws. Withdrawal of consent may affect Your ability to use certain features or functionalities of the Platform, and You will be informed of such consequences.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Principal Rights:</strong> As a Data Principal under the DPDPA, You have certain rights concerning Your Personal Data. These include the right to access information about the processing of Your data, obtain a summary of Your processed data, request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data, request erasure of Your data under certain conditions, the right to grievance redressal, and the right to nominate another person to exercise Your rights in case of death or incapacity. The process for exercising these rights is detailed in the Aurigraph Privacy Policy and typically involves contacting Aurigraph's designated Data Protection Officer or contact person.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose Limitation:</strong> Aurigraph will process Your Personal Data only for the lawful purposes specified in the notice provided at the time of consent collection and detailed in the Privacy Policy. Data will not be processed for purposes incompatible with those originally specified without obtaining further consent, where required.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> Aurigraph will limit the collection and processing of Personal Data to what is adequate, relevant, and necessary for the specified purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Aurigraph will make reasonable efforts to ensure that Personal Data processed is accurate and kept up to date, particularly if it is likely to be used for decisions affecting the Data Principal or shared with other entities. You also have a duty under DPDPA to provide verifiably authentic information when requesting corrections.</li>
        <li><strong>Children's Data:</strong> Aurigraph does not knowingly collect Personal Data from individuals under the age of 18 without obtaining verifiable consent from their parent or legal guardian, as required by the DPDPA. If the Platform involves processing children's data, Aurigraph will refrain from any processing likely to cause harm to the child and will not engage in tracking, behavioral monitoring, or targeted advertising directed at children unless specifically permitted by law and appropriate safeguards are in place.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Retention and Erasure:</strong> Personal Data will not be retained for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it was processed. Data will be erased upon withdrawal of consent (unless retention is legally required), when the purpose is fulfilled, or upon a valid erasure request from the Data Principal. Specific retention periods may be defined in the Privacy Policy or dictated by program requirements (e.g., carbon project monitoring periods).</li>
        <li><strong>Breach Notification:</strong> In the event of a Personal Data breach that is likely to affect Data Principals, Aurigraph will notify the Data Protection Board of India and the affected Data Principals as required by the DPDPA, providing details about the breach and mitigation measures taken.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.2 Data Security</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Aurigraph Measures:</strong> Aurigraph implements and maintains reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data stored and processed on the AUREX Platform, including Personal Data and User Content. These measures may include access controls, encryption of data during transfer and potentially at rest, regular security assessments, data backup procedures, and employee training. We strive to protect data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, loss, or destruction.</li>
        <li><strong>User Responsibilities:</strong> You acknowledge that You play a crucial role in data security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your Account credentials (as per Section 2.3) and for securing the devices (computers, mobile phones, tablets, drone equipment) You use to access the Platform. Field Agents, in particular, must ensure the physical and digital security of data collection devices and promptly upload data to minimize local storage risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> While Aurigraph takes reasonable security measures, You acknowledge that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, Aurigraph cannot guarantee absolute security of Your data. You use the Platform and transmit data at Your own risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.3 Data Ownership</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Content / Client Data:</strong> As between You and Aurigraph, You retain all ownership rights, title, and interest, including all Intellectual Property Rights, in and to the raw data and content that You submit, upload, or input into the AUREX Platform ("User Content" or "Client Data"). This includes, for example, farm boundary KML/shapefiles, information about historical or current farming practices entered manually, soil test results uploaded, photographs taken and uploaded by You (excluding those taken by Field Agents as part of the Service), and specific consent preferences You set.</li>
        <li><strong>Platform Data / Derived Data:</strong> Aurigraph owns and retains all rights, title, and interest, including all Intellectual Property Rights, in and to the AUREX Platform itself, its underlying software, technology, algorithms, models, databases, documentation, and any data generated by the Platform through the processing of User Content, sensor inputs (e.g., drone imagery, IoT readings collected as part of the Service), or other data sources ("Platform Data"). This includes, but is not limited to, processed or calibrated sensor data, derived vegetation indices, soil moisture maps, AWD phase predictions, biomass estimations, carbon sequestration calculations, aggregated industry benchmarks, anonymized usage statistics, and any reports, insights, or recommendations generated by the Platform's analytical engines. The distinction between raw User Content and processed Platform Data is crucial; while the inputs may belong to the User, the processed outputs and the methods of processing belong to Aurigraph.</li>
        <li><strong>License to Aurigraph for User Content:</strong> You hereby grant Aurigraph a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable (to service providers acting on Our behalf), and transferable license to access, use, host, store, reproduce, process, modify, adapt, publish, transmit, distribute, and display Your User Content solely for the following limited purposes: (a) to provide, operate, maintain, and improve the AUREX Platform and Services for You and other users; (b) to generate Platform Data (ensuring that any publicly shared or commercially used Platform Data derived from Your User Content is aggregated and anonymized such that You or Your specific farm cannot be identified, unless otherwise agreed or required for specific program participation); (c) to fulfill Our contractual obligations to You, including generating reports and insights specific to Your Account; (d) to perform research and development activities to enhance the Platform; (e) to enforce these Terms and prevent misuse; and (f) to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes.

    <h3>8.4 No Guarantee of Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Aurigraph makes no guarantees regarding any specific results or outcomes from Your use of the Platform. This includes, without limitation, any guarantee of increased crop yields, specific levels of water savings from AWD, achievement of particular carbon sequestration targets, successful generation or sale of carbon credits, improved soil health, or increased profitability. The Platform provides tools and data to support decision-making, but the ultimate responsibility for farm management practices and outcomes rests with the Farmer or User.</p>

    <h3>8.5 Third-Party Services/Data</h3>
    <p>The Platform may integrate with or rely on third-party services, data sources (e.g., weather feeds, satellite base imagery, carbon registries), or software. Aurigraph disclaims all responsibility and liability for the accuracy, availability, legality, performance, or security of any such third-party services, data, or integrations. Your use of third-party services may be subject to their respective terms and conditions and privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <h3>9.1 Exclusion of Indirect Damages</h3>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL AURIGRAPH, ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE PLATFORM OR SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT AURIGRAPH HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THIS INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES RESULTING FROM: (A) THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE; (B) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES; (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (D) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE; OR (E) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICE.</p>

    <h3>9.2 Cap on Direct Damages</h3>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AURIGRAPH'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF: (A) THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FEES, IF ANY, PAID BY YOU TO AURIGRAPH FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SPECIFIC SERVICE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY; OR (B) ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (USD $100.00) OR ITS EQUIVALENT IN LOCAL CURRENCY. This cap is set considering both the potential value derived from the service and the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with agricultural data and technology, aiming for a balance between protecting Aurigraph and providing a reasonable recourse for users, particularly where services might influence significant farming or financial decisions.</p>

    <h3>9.3 Exceptions</h3>
    <p>The limitations of liability set forth in this Section 9 shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law, such as liability arising from Aurigraph's gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud, or for death or personal injury caused by Aurigraph's negligence. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to You.</p>

    <h3>9.4 Basis of Bargain</h3>
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that the warranty disclaimers in Section 8 and the limitations of liability in this Section 9 are reasonable and form an essential basis of the bargain between You and Aurigraph. Aurigraph would not be able to provide the Platform on an economically feasible basis without these limitations.</p>

    <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
    <h3>10.1 User Indemnity</h3>
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Aurigraph, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to: (a) Your violation of these Terms or Your use of the Platform, including, but not limited to, Your User Content; (b) any use of the Platform's content, services, and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms; (c) Your violation of any applicable law or regulation; (d) Your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Right, publicity, confidentiality, property, or privacy right; or (e) any dispute or issue between You and any third party, including other Users of the Platform. Aurigraph reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by You, in which event You will cooperate with Aurigraph in asserting any available defenses.</p>

    <h2>11. Term, Termination, and Suspension</h2>
    <h3>11.1 Term</h3>
    <p>This Agreement shall commence on the date You first accept these Terms (as described in the Preamble and Section 1.3) and shall continue in effect until terminated by either You or Aurigraph as set forth in this Section 11.

    <h3>11.3 Termination or Suspension by Aurigraph</h3>

    </ul>
    <p>Aurigraph will generally attempt to provide notice of suspension or termination, but is not obligated to do so, especially in cases of severe violations or security risks.</p>

    <h3>11.4 Effects of Termination</h3>

Aurigraph is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from such deletion.</li>
        <li>(d) Any fees owed to Aurigraph prior to termination will become immediately due and payable.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>11.5 Data Retrieval</h3>
    <p>Upon Your written request made within a specified period following the effective date of termination, Aurigraph will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide You with an opportunity to export or retrieve Your User Content stored in Your Account, in a standard format determined by Aurigraph. After this period, Aurigraph may permanently delete Your User Content from its systems, subject to legal and regulatory retention requirements, particularly for Personal Data under DPDPA. Aurigraph reserves the right to charge a fee for data retrieval assistance.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <h3>12.1 Governing Law</h3>
    <p>This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of India, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule. This choice of law is made considering the applicability of the DPDPA and the likely location of a significant portion of the User base (Farmers, Field Agents, etc.) within India, ensuring relevance and facilitating compliance and enforcement.</p>

    <h3>12.2 Dispute Resolution Mechanism</h3>
    <p>The parties agree to attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof (collectively, "Disputes") through good faith negotiation first.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>(a) Negotiation:</strong> Either party may initiate negotiations by providing written notice to the other party, describing the subject of the Dispute and the relief requested. The parties shall attempt to resolve the Dispute through informal negotiation within a specified timeframe from the date the notice is received.</li>
        <li><strong>(b) Arbitration:</strong> If the Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation within the specified period, the Dispute shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered in accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 of India.
            <ul>
                <li>The number of arbitrators shall be one (1), mutually appointed by the parties. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within a specified period of the demand for arbitration, the arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the said Act.</li>
                <li>The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be specified.</li>
                <li>The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English.</li>
                <li>The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>(c) Exception for Injunctive Relief:</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party shall have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.</li>
        <li><strong>(d) Jurisdiction:</strong> Subject to the arbitration clause above, the parties irrevocably agree that the courts located in a specified city shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement. This approach aims to provide a structured and potentially more efficient resolution process while ensuring relevance to the primary operational and legal context in India.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>13.3 Waiver</h3>
    <p>No waiver by Aurigraph of any term or condition set out in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Aurigraph to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

    <h3>13.4 Assignment</h3>

    <h3>13.6 Force Majeure</h3>
